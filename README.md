# CRUD project
1. Introduction
The CRUD project is a web application that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a dataset. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four fundamental operations to manage data in a database. The project provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the dataset and perform these operations seamlessly.

2. Features
The CRUD project comes with the following features:

Create: Add new records to the dataset using a user-friendly form.
Read: Display the existing records in a tabular format, allowing users to view the data easily.
Update: Modify the existing records' information through a user-friendly interface.
Delete: Remove unwanted records from the dataset using a simple deletion process.

3. Technologies Used
The CRUD project is built using the following technologies:

Front-end:

HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for creating the user interface.
Front-end framework (Django).

Back-end:

Server-side language ( Python) - choose based on your preferences and the compatibility with the selected front-end framework.
Database system (MySQL).

4. Installation
Follow these steps to set up the CRUD project locally on your machine:

Clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/crud-project.git

Change into the project directory:

cd crud-project

Install the necessary dependencies for the back-end (server-side) and front-end (client-side). Use appropriate package managers based on your chosen technologies.

Set up the database according to the chosen database system. Import the sample dataset if available.

Configure the connection between the back-end and the database.

5. Usage
To run the CRUD project, follow these steps:

Start the back-end server:

# Replace 'start-command' with the appropriate command for your back-end setup
start-command
python manage.py runserver


Launch the front-end application:

# Replace 'start-command' with the appropriate command for your front-end setup
start-command
python manage.py runserver 8080


Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:port, where port is the port number specified in your back-end and front-end configurations.

You should now be able to access the CRUD project and start performing CRUD operations on the dataset.
